# StaGen

## Overview

**StaGen** is a Unity tool that allows you to create stages procedurally using Procedural Content Generation Algorithms such as Binary Space Partitioning, Perlin Noise, and Bracketed L-System.

This project was developed by Tomás Concha and Joel Díaz, students of Video Game Development and Virtual Reality Engineering at the University of Talca, as part of Project 1 of the Procedural Content Generation module

## Instructions for use

To run the program, follow these instructions:

1. Download the .zip folder with the project.
2. Unzip the folder.
3. Open the “Procedural-Content-Generation” file with Unity.

Once the program is open and running, follow these instructions to use the tools:

1. Open the tool panel by pressing the Expand button with the “>” symbol on the left side of the screen.
2. This will display the tool panel, where you will see three tabs: BSP, Perlin Noise, and L-System.<ol type="a">
     <li>Select BSP to modify the parameters of the Binary Space Partitioning Construction Algorithm.</li>
     <li>Select Perlin Noise to modify the parameters of the Perlin Noise Algorithm.</li>
     <li>Select L-System to modify the parameters of the Bracketed L-System.</li>
   </ol>
3. In each of these tabs, you will find different elements such as Toggles, Sliders, and Input Fields. Try different combinations of parameters to experiment with different results.
